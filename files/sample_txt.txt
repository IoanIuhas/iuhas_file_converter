PyCharm is a cross-platform IDE that provides consistent experience on the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

PyCharm is available in two editions: Professional, and Community. The Community edition is an open-source project, and it's free, but it has fewer features. The Professional edition is commercial, and provides an outstanding set of tools and features.
